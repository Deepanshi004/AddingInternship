# Internship Portal Backend

This is the backend REST API server for the Internship Portal built using:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (via Mongoose)

## Features

- Manage internships: create, read, update, delete (CRUD)
- User authentication (if implemented)
- RESTful API endpoints

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
````

2. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file (MongoDB URI, PORT, etc.)

3. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified PORT).

```

If you want, I can generate the full README files for other parts too!
